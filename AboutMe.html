        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am Jaro Nieuwenhuisen a Junior C# programmer / Software Engineer.
            I am 17 years old and currently studying at CMGT in Saxion Enschede.
            I started programming in Primary school so I already got some projects, you will be able to find those on my
            itch and github pages.
            I have also posted the 3 first projects of my study and the gamejam we did the first week.
            Other hobbies I have are playing the piano, playing my sport which is water polo, cooking, playing Magic The
            Gathering either online or in real life, TTRPG's such as DND or Warhammer and of course gaming.
